# Gmu_Room_Booking

This java program uses selenium package to automate room bookings at mason frenwickk library. The script asks for name, mason email and what type of room to book(2 person, 4 person ,6 person or 8 person). It goes through all the rooms in the building and checks which ones are available. Program books the first room that is available. It books for maximumm amount of time(GMU allows each room to be booked for maximum of 2.5 hours). Once the room is booked there should be an conformation email in your mason email.
